##Prep Capstone Project
This project is intended to explore the concepts of data science and is a preliminary Capstone for the Thinkful Data Science Bootcamp

###Data Science Concepts:
Investigated and explored the topics of hypothesis testing and data visualization as well as deepening my knowledge of Python.  

###Instructions:
file of interest(s):

 - Prep_Capstone_UnX.py

Installation:

	>>>npm ..

Run the script:
	
	>>>python3 Prep_Capstone_UnX.py

###Environment and Dependencies:

	- Ubuntu 16.04.1
	- Python 3.5
	- numpy 1.12.0
	- scipy 0.18.1
	- matplotlib 1.5.1

###Proposal:
This data set shows whether an individual either makes more or less than 50K per year and factors which may effect that (age, education, race, sex, etcâ€¦). The data is from the 2014 census.
My goal is to show what level of education someone must have in order to have a 50% probability of having an income greater than 50K

###Implementation techniques:


###Procedures:
To begin, I use a bar and pie chart to show the amounts in the sample per education level. From there I will use t-tests from Scipy to evaluate if we should accept that a certain education level will give you a 50% chance of having an income above 50K. I used a random sample of 1000 people from the data set.

###Findings:
The majority of the sample were high school graduates and graduates with some college education. The smallest groups were those with doctorates and professional degrees.

There is a clear difference in the income levels of each education group. The trend below shows that those with more years of schooling have better chance of having a higher income.

In order to reject the null hypothesis for the alternative (>50% chance to have a >50K income) the t-test must be positive and the P-Value must be below .1 at a 10% significance level.

As you can see from the table below, only a doctorate or professional degree has enough evidence to show that there is a greater than 50% chance to have a 50K income.

###Issues and Problems: 
Although the data set is very clean, it only has two values for income, >50K or <=50K. If the data included values for gross income as well, we could better estimate the marginal effect of education on income. 

Code Issues:  
I wanted to create an ANOVA table using the Pyvtble however the module was not working. I left the commented code in for the future:


    import pyvttble
        # df_400_pvyt = pt.DataFrame(df_400)
    # print (df_400_pvyt.anova1way('Income_Value','Education'))
    
###Conclusion:
What overall findings through your research did you come across and what conclusions do you have.  Post numbers and image here too for reference.

According to the hypotehsis test, only a doctorate and a professional degree increase one's chance of having an income above 50K over 50%. 

Code Issues:  
An example of the code issues I came across..


There were also issues running the module Pyvttbl, which is used to create the ANOVA table. The code is still in the program commented out for the future.

    "firstName": {
        ".validate":"newData.isString()"
    },
    "lastName": {
        ".validate":"newData.isString()"
    },
    "phoneNumber": {
        ".validate":"newData.isString() && newData.val().length == 11"
    }
