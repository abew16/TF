Instructions:

Proposal:
This data set shows whether an individual either makes more or less than 50K per year and factors which may effect that (age, education, race, sex, etcâ€¦). The data is from the 2014 census.
My goal is to show what level of education someone must have in order to have a 50% probability of having an income greater than 50K

Implementation techniques:
Initially, I use a bar and pie chart to show the amounts of the sample per education level. From there I will use t-tests from Scipy to evaluate if we should accept that a certain education level will give you a 50% chance of having an income above 50K.
